Error Detection and Correction: Digital transmission allows for error detection and correction techniques to be implemented. These techniques can identify and correct errors that may occur during transmission, ensuring data integrity.

Block coding can introduce redundancy to help the receiver maintain synchronization. Additionally, techniques like scrambling can be used to avoid long sequences of zeros or ones that might disrupt synchronization.    

Analog Transmission: In analog transmission, synchronization is typically achieved through the use of a carrier signal. The receiver is tuned to the frequency of the carrier signal, allowing it to synchronize with the incoming modulated signal. In synchronous transmission, the bit stream is combined into frames, and the receiver must keep an accurate count of the bits to separate them into bytes.
